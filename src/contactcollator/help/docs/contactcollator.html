	<h1>Contact Collator</h1>
	<p>The Contact Collator module is designed to provide a common output from multiple detectors and classifiers and to provide 
	a “one-stop” data stream summarising recent detector activity. It can be configured to take input from multiple detectors and 
	apply data selection to those data, for example to select different types of click events from the click detector or the click 
	train detector. When a threshold number of detections occur for within a user defined time frame, new “Contact” data are output 
	for that detection stream. </p>
<p>Each Contact output data consists of the following information:<p>
<ol>
<li>The name of the detector that created the contact</li>
<li>A list of detections that formed the contact</li>
<li>An audio clip of data from the last detection</li>
<li>A summary of bearing information to detection in the form of a mean and standard deviation of bearings in detections 
that formed that contact. If the input data contain multiple other ‘sub’ detections (e.g. clicks within a click train detection), 
the bearing information is extracted for each sub detection.</li> 
<li>A bearing histogram for the input data, i.e. data to form a polar histogram for the direction of arrival to the detections</li>
</ol>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>The Contact Collator is a plugin module and does not come as a standard part of a PAMGuard installation. To add the Contact Collator to an installation, 
you should add the latest ContactCollator_**_**.jar file to the plugins folder of your PAMGuard installation.</p>

<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>Once installed, to add a Contact Collator to a PAMGuard configuration, it can be selected from the 'Add Modules / Utilities' menu.</p>
<p>You should then configure the Contact Collator from the 'Settings / Contact Collator Settings ...' menu.</p>
<p>You can add any number of detector streams to the contact collator, depending on which other PAMGuard modules have been configured. To add a new stream, press the 'Add Stream' button
and a dialog will appear for you to fill in with the name, detection source and other information about the output stream.</p>

<br>
<p>If the detection source has a data filter, which allows you to only select certain types of detection (e.g. a particular type of classified click, or whistles from within a certain frequency range,
then the settings button to the right of the Detection Source drop down will be enables. Data selection settings are specific to each detector type and may depend on how that detector was configured.</p>
<p>The output from the contact collator includes short waveform clips of data. Select a data source for this, which will normally be the raw data from the sound acquisition module, however, if you 
have decimated data to a lower frequency, you may want to use the decimated data. Set the clip length and the minimum time period between sending outputs. </p>

<h2>Display</h2>
	
	<p>A summary display, which shows the last clip and bearing information for each detector stream can be added to any PAMGuard user display from the user display's menu.
