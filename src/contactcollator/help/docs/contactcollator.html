	<h1>Contact Collator</h1>
	<p>The Contact Collator module is designed to provide a common output from multiple detectors and classifiers and to provide 
	a “one-stop” data stream summarising recent detector activity. It can be configured to take input from multiple detectors and 
	apply data selection to those data, for example to select different types of click events from the click detector or the click 
	train detector. When a threshold number of detections occur for within a user defined time frame, new “Contact” data are output 
	for that detection stream. </p>
<p>Each Contact output data consists of the following information:<p>
<ol>
<li>The name of the detector that created the contact</li>
<li>A list of detections that formed the contact</li>
<li>An audio clip of data from the last detection</li>
<li>A summary of bearing information to detection in the form of a mean and standard deviation of bearings in detections 
that formed that contact. If the input data contain multiple other ‘sub’ detections (e.g. clicks within a click train detection), 
the bearing information is extracted for each sub detection.</li> 
<li>A bearing histogram for the input data, i.e. data to form a polar histogram for the direction of arrival to the detections</li>

</ol>
